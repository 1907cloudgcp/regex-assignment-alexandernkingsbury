1.) egrep '^[Z]' cities.txt -i
	Used egrep instead of grep for the sake of consistency
	^ denotes start of the string, with the z being the only thing to be checked for
	cities.txt is the name of the file to check
	-i is to disable case sensitivity

2.) egrep 'gan$' cities.txt -i
	While searching for gan, the $ denotes to search at the end

3.) egrep '^D|^A|^E' cities.txt -i | wc -l
	| is used to denote a or statment to check for other valid conditions
	wc is the word count command
	-l makes it count the number of lines

6.).1) egrep '(.){14}' cities.txt -i
	if white space is wanted 
	{n} is used to repeat the segment n number of times

6.).2) egrep '[- ](.){14}|[a-z]{14}' cities.txt -i

	I'll be completly honest I put [- ] there by mistake, couldn't find out
	what it was online, and got me info that was not listed on the assignment page
	which if I am not mistaken should be part of the awnser, below is a example, rest is on the bottom
